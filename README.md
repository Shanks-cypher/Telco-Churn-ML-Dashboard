# Telco-Churn-ML-Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a multi-billion dollar problem in the telecommunications industry. This project provides an end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to identify high-risk customers before they leave. By analyzing historical patterns in tenure, contract types, and billing, the model provides actionable risk scores through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

💡 The Problem & Solution
The Business Problem: High customer turnover leads to lost revenue and increased acquisition costs. Identifying "why" customers leave is often too slow for manual analysis.

The Analytical Solution: I built a predictive pipeline that moves beyond simple correlations. By stripping away "obvious" survey data (like Satisfaction Scores), I forced the model to find hidden churn triggers within behavioral and financial data—such as the risk associated with Month-to-Month contracts and Fiber Optic service costs.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Core programming and logic.
